In Heauton Timorumenos (Greek for The Self-Tormenter), the Roman playwright 
Publius Terentius Afer, or Terence for his philistine Anglo-Saxon friends, puts these
words into the mouth of the character Chremes: 
> 'homo sum: humani nil a me alienum puto.'

In case your Latin isn't up to standards (mine certainly isn't), Chremes is outing
himself here as a human, and admitting that nothing human is alien to him. 

If you also like to torment yourself, this might just be the library for you.
Chremes provides all the tools you need to create workers with a bunch of human-like
features.

TODO
- generate human (not necessarily unique) name for each worker
- workers are unreliable: some produce too much, others spend so much time on Facebook
  they hardly achieve anything in a day
- worker can go on sabbatical (and start posting pictures on Insta from his world trip)
- worker can decide he can no longer take it and quit (job or life - leave that in the 
  middle to maintain levity)
